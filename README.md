# SortingFlightsCpp
Task project, not much use from it.

Program designed to work with special formated (txt) files which represent lists of Flights.
When program is started, it loads data from one file (passed as command line argument or default one),
and then waits for user to select next operation.

User can load another file from anywhere in computer, then when file is loaded, user can select sort option
which will then sort list, and he/she can go through changes one by one.

Also user can select sort algorithm, and sort criteria before he/she sort the list.

Program provides user ability to save sorted list file, in default directory (or in some other, if
user changes it manually thorugh options), and also to save sort information (not much use of that
in this constelation but it can be usefull generally).

It is built as GUI application using FLTK library.

Application is built using Microsoft Visual Studio 2012.
